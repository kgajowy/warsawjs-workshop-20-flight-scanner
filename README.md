# warsawjs-workshop-20-flight-scanner

Repository for React Basics Workshop which will take (took) place on 19.05.2018 in Warsaw.

## What we will build?

A simple app like LOT/Wizzair search for multiple airlines. App involves simple search criteria, loading results from online API, presenting the results and more.

## Main steps

Please find the proposed agenda below - what we will build step by step.

### App Core

- [ ] initialize the app core/main screen
- [ ] run the project
- [ ] make a simple change and observe how the results change
- [ ] a few words about development/production "builds"

### Pseudo-scenes / main states / navigation

- [ ] what is a React Component?
- [ ] creating and including a simple component ("Next Button")
- [ ] "props" - what it is?
- [ ] creating a target component with results
- [ ] making them "work" together (naive way)
- [ ] a few words about router
- [ ] making a "transition" -> adding a click event

### Adding dependencies - material-ui / styling

- [ ] installing the dependency
- [ ] changing "Next Button" to use materia-ui
- [ ] testing a few other component we will need (Datepicker, ActivityIndicator/Spinner)
- [ ] Create 2 inputs with "dummy" source

### Adding dependencies - axios / API Service

- [ ] installing the dependency
- [ ] making a "Service" to fetch Locations
- [ ] few words about Views, Models and Services

### Basic inputs for searcher

- [ ] keeping values in "state" - what it is and how it differs from props? (change over time vs. const)
- [ ] make the inputs "aware" of pending/loading state (locations)
- [ ] provide data to inputs
- [ ] keeping input current value in state

### Spinner/Loader state - a few words about UX/UI

- [ ] basic "validation" and button look
- [ ] pending state & ActivityIndicator
- [ ] calling the hero API - FlightService & FlightModel 
- [ ] transition

### Results Model & Presentation

- [ ] displaying the Flight Model
- [ ] (l)oops!

### Basic filtering - client side

- [ ] adding min/max (price) inputs+checkboxes & listeners
- [ ] filtering the results
